I have experience and expertise in web development with a focus on Node.js, React.js, Express, Laravel, PHP, Tailwind, Bootstrap, and MongoDB. In backend development, I can build robust and scalable systems using Node.js and Laravel/PHP, with capabilities such as server-side scripting, database management (MySQL & MongoDB), and API integration. I am also proficient in version control using Git and GitHub for collaborative development and project management.

In the frontend side, I am skilled in using React.js with Redux to create interactive and responsive user interfaces. Apart from that, I am proficient in using Tailwind and Bootstrap as CSS frameworks, as well as experience in UI/UX design using Figma and Canva. I have strong knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals which allows me to build modern and engaging web applications.
